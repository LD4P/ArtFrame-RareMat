--------

bibliotek-o, the BIBFRAME extension created by LD4L-Labs and the LD4P Ontology Group, takes a slightly different approach to recording titles than BIBFRAME itself. For example, bibliotek-o distinguishes between title sources and title origins, allows for indicating transcribed versus supplied titles, the ordering of subtitles, and the creation of sort titles by providing the possibility to separate initial articles from the title proper. This document discusses if the bibliotek-o title model covers the use cases identified by the ArtFrame team and the ArtFrame Extension Group related to naming art objects and identifies areas not covered that need to be addressed in the ArtFrame extension.

--------

After testing the bibliotek-o title model, the ArtFrame group agreed that it can generally be applied to art objects. The group also investigated specific art cataloging standards (such as CCO, CDWA and DCRM(G)) for other requirements unique to art objects. In particular, the group discussed title types listed in CCO Chapter 1, p. 49-50 ([*http://cco.vrafoundation.org/downloads/PartTwo_1-ObjectNaming.pdf*](http://cco.vrafoundation.org/downloads/PartTwo_1-ObjectNaming.pdf)) as well as CDWA ([*http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/4titles.html*](http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/4titles.html)). Most of these title types (e.g. creatorâ€™s title or repository title) are very relevant concepts, but can be expressed in other ways in a linked data environment. Two remaining title types were identified that need to be formally expressed in the ArtFrame ontology: exhibition title and translated title. 

> - **Recommendations:**
Exhibition title will be addressed in the Exhibition Event Model. Translated title will be accomodated in the ArtFrame ontology as a named individual to be used with bib:origin. While ex:translated differs from most of the other named individuals in this category, including it follows precedent set by bib:supplied and bib:transcribed.
